put.io-adder
============

"Put.io adder" is a small OS X app, that adds a new handler for "magnet:" URL schemes, so that every time you click
on a "magnet:" link, the app opens, and adds the link to your put.io queue.

NOTES:
- The app requires you to have a put.io account. They're probably not free anymore.
- The app requires KeyChain Access to store put.io's OAuth Token.
